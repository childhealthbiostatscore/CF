  abstract = {Now available in Open Access, this best-selling textbook for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergraduate math majors and graduate students. The fourth edition gives an expanded treatment of the singular value decomposition and its consequences. It includes a new chapter on multilinear algebra, treating bilinear forms, quadratic forms, tensor products, and an approach to determinants via alternating multilinear forms. This new edition also increases the use of the minimal polynomial to provide cleaner proofs of multiple results. Also, over 250 new exercises have been added. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. Beautiful formatting creates pages with an unusually student-friendly appearance in both print and electronic versions. No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. The text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator},

  abstract = {While A1C is well established as an important risk marker for diabetes complications, with the increasing use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to help facilitate safe and effective diabetes management, it is important to understand how CGM metrics, such as mean glucose, and A1C correlate. Estimated A1C (eA1C) is a measure converting the mean glucose from CGM or self-monitored blood glucose readings, using a formula derived from glucose readings from a population of individuals, into an estimate of a simultaneously measured laboratory A1C. Many patients and clinicians find the eA1C to be a helpful educational tool, but others are often confused or even frustrated if the eA1C and laboratory-measured A1C do not agree. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration determined that the nomenclature of eA1C needed to change. This led the authors to work toward a multipart solution to facilitate the retention of such a metric, which includes renaming the eA1C the glucose management indicator (GMI) and generating a new formula for converting CGM-derived mean glucose to GMI based on recent clinical trials using the most accurate CGM systems available. The final aspect of ensuring a smooth transition from the old eA1C to the new GMI is providing new CGM analyses and explanations to further understand how to interpret GMI and use it most effectively in clinical practice. This Perspective will address why a new name for eA1C was needed, why GMI was selected as the new name, how GMI is calculated, and how to understand and explain GMI if one chooses to use GMI as a tool in diabetes education or management.},

  abstract = {Abstract             RNA-seq is currently considered the most powerful, robust and adaptable technique for measuring gene expression and transcription activation at genome-wide level. As the analysis of RNA-seq data is complex, it has prompted a large amount of research on algorithms and methods. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of options available at each step of the analysis. Consequently, there is no clear consensus about the most appropriate algorithms and pipelines that should be used to analyse RNA-seq data. In the present study, 192 pipelines using alternative methods were applied to 18 samples from two human cell lines and the performance of the results was evaluated. Raw gene expression signal was quantified by non-parametric statistics to measure precision and accuracy. Differential gene expression performance was estimated by testing 17 differential expression methods. The procedures were validated by qRT-PCR in the same samples. This study weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of the tested algorithms and pipelines providing a comprehensive guide to the different methods and procedures applied to the analysis of RNA-seq data, both for the quantification of the raw expression signal and for the differential gene expression.},

  abstract = {Background Forced expiratory volume in 1 s as a percentage of predicted (\%FEV1) is a key outcome in cystic fibrosis (CF) and other lung diseases. As people with CF survive for longer periods, new methods are required to understand the way \%FEV1 changes over time. An up to date approach for longitudinal modelling of \%FEV1 is presented and applied to a unique CF dataset to demonstrate its utility at the clinical and population level. Methods and findings The Danish CF register contains 70\hphantom{,}448 \%FEV1 measures on 479 patients seen monthly between 1969 and 2010. The variability in the data is partitioned into three components (between patient, within patient and measurement error) using the empirical variogram. Then a linear mixed effects model is developed to explore factors influencing \%FEV1 in this population. Lung function measures are correlated for over 15\hspace{0.25em}years. A baseline \%FEV1 value explains 63\% of the variability in \%FEV1 at 1\hspace{0.25em}year, 40\% at 3\hspace{0.25em}years, and about 30\% at 5\hspace{0.25em}years. The model output smooths out the short-term variability in \%FEV1 (SD 6.3\%), aiding clinical interpretation of changes in \%FEV1. At the population level significant effects of birth cohort, pancreatic status and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection status on \%FEV1 are shown over time. Conclusions This approach provides a more realistic estimate of the \%FEV1 trajectory of people with chronic lung disease by acknowledging the imprecision in individual measurements and the correlation structure of repeated measurements on the same individual over time. This method has applications for clinicians in assessing prognosis and the need for treatment intensification, and for use in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.             Results: To align our large (\&gt;80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of \&gt;50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 {\texttimes} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80{\textendash}90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

Objective               To evaluate hypoglycemia in children and young adults with CF by OGTT and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).                                         Methods               A 3-h OGTT was performed in children and young adults with CF and healthy controls (HC). Individuals were classified as experiencing hypoglycemia on OGTT (glucose {$<$}70\,mg/dL) or not. Insulin, C-peptide, glucose, glucagon, and incretins were measured. CGM was performed for 7 days in the free-living setting. Measures of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function accounting for insulin sensitivity, and insulin clearance were calculated.                                         Results                                A total of 57 participants (40 CF and 17 HC) underwent assessment. Rates of hypoglycemia by OGTT were similar in pwCF (53\%, 21/40) compared to HC (35\%, 6/17),                 p                 \,=\,0.23. PwCF compared to HC had higher A1c; on OGTT higher and later glucose peaks, later insulin peaks; and on CGM more glucose variability. CF Hypo+ versus CF Hypo- had higher lung function, higher insulin sensitivity, higher beta cell function accounting for insulin sensitivity, and decreased CGM variability. When comparing CF Hypo+ to HC Hypo+, although rates of hypoglycemia are similar, pwCF had blunted glucagon responses to hypoglycemia. OGTT hypoglycemia was not associated with CGM hypoglycemia in any group.                                                        Conclusion               Youth with CF have increased insulin sensitivity and impaired glucagon response to hypoglycemia on OGTT. Hypoglycemia on OGTT did not associate with free-living hypoglycemia.},

We aimed to describe the distribution and provide reference quartiles of OGTT-related variables in the Italian cystic fibrosis population. Methods: Cross-sectional study of PwCF receiving care in three Italian cystic fibrosis centers of excellence, from 2016 to 2020. We performed a modified 2-h OGTT protocol (1.75 g/kg, maximum 75 g), sampling at baseline and at 30-min intervals, analyzing plasma glucose, serum insulin, and C-peptide. The modified OGTT allowed for the modeling of {$\beta$} cell function. For all variables, multivariable quantile regression was performed to estimate the median, the 25th, and 75th percentiles, with age, sex, and pancreatic insufficiency as predictors. Results: We have quantified the deterioration of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion with age according to sex and pancreatic insufficiency, highlighting a deviation from linearity both for patients {$<$}10 years and {$>$}35 years of age. Conclusions: References of OGTT variables for PwCF provide a necessary tool to not only identify patients at risk for CFRD or other cystic fibrosis-related complications, but also to evaluate the effects of promising pharmacological therapies.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

  abstract = {Abstract             The analysis of covariance provides a common approach to adjusting for a baseline covariate in medical research. With Gaussian errors, adding random covariates does not change either the theory or the computations of general linear model data analysis. However, adding random covariates does change the theory and computation of power analysis. Many data analysts fail to fully account for this complication in planning a study. We present our results in five parts. (i) A review of published results helps document the importance of the problem and the limitations of available methods. (ii) A taxonomy for general linear multivariate models and hypotheses allows identifying a particular problem. (iii) We describe how random covariates introduce the need to consider quantiles and conditional values of power. (iv) We provide new exact and approximate methods for power analysis of a range of multivariate models with a Gaussian baseline covariate, for both small and large samples. The new results apply to the Hotelling{\textendash}Lawley test and the four tests in the ``univariate'' approach to repeated measures (unadjusted, Huynh-Feldt, Geisser-Greenhouse, Box). The techniques allow rapid calculation and an interactive, graphical approach to sample size choice. (v) Calculating power for a clinical trial of a treatment for increasing bone density illustrates the new methods. We particularly recommend using quantile power with a new Satterthwaite-style approximation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, screening rates remain consistently low. We conducted surveys of 1) US CF center directors and 2) Endocrinologists affiliated with the CFF-sponsored EnVision program to characterize CFRD screening practices, describe provider perceived barriers to screening, and identify strategies for improving screening.                                         Methods               The surveys queried OGTT protocols, alternate screening strategies, and perceived barriers to screening. CF center characteristics and procedures for coordinating OGTTs were compared between centers achieving {$\geq$}50\% versus \&lt;50\% OGTT completion. Endocrinologists received additional questions regarding OGTT interpretation and management.                                         Results               The survey response rate was 18\% (51/290) from CF Centers and 63\% (25/40) from Endocrinologists. The majority (57\%) of CF centers utilized 2 OGTT timepoints (0,120 min). The majority (72\%) of Endocrinologists utilized 3 timepoints (0,60,120 min). Four percent of CF centers and 8\% of Endocrinologists utilized other timepoints. Forty-nine percent of CF centers reported {$\geq$}50\% OGTT completion in the past year. Completion of {$\geq$}50\% OGTT was 5 times more likely when patient reminders were consistently provided (p = 0.017). Both CF Centers and Endocrinologists employed alternative screening strategies including HbA1c (64\%, 92\%), fasting plasma glucose (49\%, 67\%), continuous glucose monitoring (30\%, 58\%), and home fingerstick monitoring (55\%, 50\%).                                         Discussion               OGTT is the gold standard screening method for CFRD, but completion rates remain suboptimal, practice variation exists, and many providers utilize alternate screening strategies. Systematic reminders may improve completion rates. Studies to improve our approach to CFRD screening are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Little is known about cough frequency in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to determine (1) daytime and overnight cough rates in patients with CF at the beginning and end of a course of antibiotics for treatment of an exacerbation; (2) the relationship between cough frequencies and standard clinical measures of disease; and (3) the relationship between objective cough rates and the subjective assessment of cough. Methods: Nineteen adult patients admitted with a pulmonary exacerbation performed daytime and overnight sound recordings on admission; 13 had repeat recordings prior to discharge. Coughs were manually quantified in cough seconds (time spent coughing). Patients subjectively scored their cough using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and numerical score. Lung function, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and sputum weights were recorded. Results: Cough rates fell substantially with treatment; median fall in cough rate was 51.3\% (IQR 32.3{\textendash}77.5) (p\&lt;0.001) for daytime and 72.2\% (28.6{\textendash}90.1) (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.049) for overnight. Multivariate regression analyses showed that forced expiratory volume in 1 second and CRP levels predicted overnight cough rates on admission. On discharge, sputum volume predicted daytime cough rates. Only the change in overnight VAS correlated with the change in objective cough rates. Conclusions: The cough rate significantly decreases with treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation in adults with CF. Lung function, sputum volume, and CRP influences the cough rate, with the effects differing from day to night and between admission and discharge. Subjective reporting of a nocturnal cough may indicate a pulmonary exacerbation of CF in adults.},

Other risk factors associated with CFRD are female sex, pancreatic insufficiency, liver disease, need for gastrostomy tube feedings, history of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and poor pulmonary function. CFRD is related to worse clinical outcomes and increased mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment have been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Screening for CFRD is recommended with an annual oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) starting at age 10~years. Diagnosis of CFRD is made by standard American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria during baseline health. CFRD can also be diagnosed in individuals with CF during acute illness, while on enteral feeds, and after transplant. In this review we will discuss the epidemiology of CFRD and provide an overview of the advantages and pitfalls of current screening and diagnostic tests for CFRD.},

  abstract = {Intro: The US CFFPR includes data from {\textasciitilde}30,000 individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). We aimed to examine trends in incidence and prevalence alongside screening rates of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) from 2003-2018.             Methods: Prevalence of CFRD was defined as the percent of patients with CFRD in the registry in a given year. Annual incidence of CFRD was calculated as the number of new diagnoses per 1,000 person-years. Annual screening rates were defined as the percent of individuals without CFRD who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Individuals \&lt;10 years were excluded, and data were grouped by age decade.             Results: (Table 1) CFRD screening rates increased from 2003-2018, particularly in 10-18 yr olds. Although screening rates increased in adults as well, overall rates remain low. In 10-18 yr olds, the incidence of CFRD did not increase, and incident cases in adults decreased. The prevalence of CFRD is gradually increasing in adults.             Conclusions: Despite increased screening, the incidence of CFRD is stable or declining. CFRD prevalence is steadily rising in older adults. Screening rates and trends in CFRD incidence support a need for revised and potentially targeted screening algorithms. With increasing longevity in people with CF and rising prevalence of CFRD, there is great need for more specialists trained to care for a growing population of adults with CFRD.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.                                         Results               We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95\% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene.                                         Conclusions               RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

CFTR                 mutation frequency varies by ancestry, which is different from but related to demographic racial and ethnic group. Eligibility for CFTR modulator therapy has not been previously reported by race and ethnicity.                                                        Methods                                We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients in the 2018 CF Foundation Patient Registry. We analyzed the percentage of patients in each US Census defined racial and ethnic group eligible for CFTR modulators based on                 CFTR                 mutations approved by the US FDA and then based on both mutations and FDA approval by age. We compared lung function based on CFTR modulator eligibility and prescription.                                                        Findings                                Based on                 CFTR                 mutations alone, 92.4\% of non-Hispanic White patients, 69.7\% of Black/African American patients, 75.6\% of Hispanic patients, and 80.5\% of other race patients eligible for CFTR modulators. For each CFTR modulator, Black/African American patients were least likely to have eligible mutations, and non-Hispanic White patients were most likely. There was no difference in the disparity between racial and/or ethnic groups with the addition of current FDA approval by age. The lowest pulmonary function in the cohort was seen in non-Hispanic White, Black/African American, and Hispanic patients not eligible for CFTR modulators.                                                        Interpretation               Patients with CF from minority groups are less likely to be eligible for CFTR modulators. Because people with CF who are racial and ethnic minorities have increased disease severity and earlier mortality, this will further contribute to health disparities.},

These processes occur during coffee grinding and impact coffee production at both the enthusiast and industrial-length scales. By sourcing commercially roasted coffee as well as roasting our own, we find that roast color and grind coarseness impact the charging; fine, darker roasts acquire charge-to-mass ratios comparable to those inferred from particles in volcanic plumes and thunderclouds. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of residual internal moisture on electrification, concluding that moisture can tune both the magnitude and polarity of charge. In addition to possible technological applications, we demonstrate that the addition of external water simultaneously suppresses surface charging and clumping of ground coffee and results in notably different flow dynamics in espresso formats, likely yielding markedly different taste profiles and more concentrated extracts.},

However, there is no biological justification for such use, and it may reinforce health disparities.                                         Objective               To compare the PFT interpretations produced with race-neutral and race-specific equations.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               In this cross-sectional study, race-neutral reference equations recently developed by the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) were used to interpret PFTs performed at an academic medical center between January 2010 and December 2020. The interpretations produced with these race-neutral reference equations were compared with those produced using the race and ethnicity{\textendash}specific reference equations produced by GLI in 2012. The analysis was conducted from April to October 2022.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               The primary outcomes were differences in the percentage of obstructive, restrictive, mixed, and nonspecific lung function impairments identified using the 2 sets of reference equations. Secondary outcomes were differences in severity of these impairments.                                         Results               PFTs were interpreted from 2722 Black (686 men [25.4\%]; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [13.9] years) and 5709 White (2654 men [46.5\%]; mean [SD] age, 56.4 [14.3] years) individuals. Among Black individuals, replacing the race-specific reference equations with the race-neutral reference equations was associated with an increase in the prevalence of restriction from 26.8\% (95\% CI, 25.2\%-28.5\%) to 37.5\% (95\% CI, 35.7\%-39.3\%) and of a nonspecific pattern of impairment from 3.2\% (95\% CI, 2.5\%- 3.8\%) to 6.5\% (95\% CI, 5.6\%-7.4\%) and no significant change in the prevalence of obstruction (19.9\% [95\% CI, 18.4\%-21.4\%] vs 19.5\% [95\% CI, 18.0\%-21.0\%]). Among White individuals, replacing the race-specific reference equations with the race-neutral reference equations was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of restriction from 22.6\% (95\% CI, 21.5\%-23.6\%) to 18.0\% (95\% CI, 17.0\%-19.0\%), a decrease in the prevalence of a nonspecific pattern of impairment from 8.7\% (95\% CI, 7.9\%-9.4\%) to 4.0\% (95\% CI, 3.5\%-4.5\%), and no significant change in the percentage with obstruction from 23.9\% (95\% CI, 22.8\%-25.1\%) to 25.1\% (95\% CI, 23.9\%- 26.2\%). The race-neutral reference equations were associated with an increase in severity in 22.8\% (95\% CI, 21.2\%-24.4\%) of Black individuals and a decrease in severity in 19.3\% (95\% CI, 18.2\%-20.3\%) of White individuals vs the race-specific reference equations.                                         Conclusions and Relevance               In this cross-sectional study, the use of race-neutral reference equations to interpret PFTs resulted in a significant increase in the number of Black individuals with respiratory impairments along with a significant increase in the severity of the identified impairments. More work is needed to quantify the effect these reference equations would have on diagnosis, referral, and treatment patterns.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The convenience of linear mixed models for Gaussian data has led to their widespread use. Unfortunately, standard mixed model tests often have greatly inflated test size in small samples. Many applications with correlated outcomes in medical imaging and other fields have simple properties which do not require the generality of a mixed model. Alternately, stating the special cases as a general linear multivariate model allows analysing them with either the univariate or multivariate approach to repeated measures (UNIREP, MULTIREP). Even in small samples, an appropriate UNIREP or MULTIREP test always controls test size and has a good power approximation, in sharp contrast to mixed model tests. Hence, mixed model tests should never be used when one of the UNIREP tests (uncorrected, Huynh{\textendash}Feldt, Geisser{\textendash}Greenhouse, Box conservative) or MULTIREP tests (Wilks, Hotelling{\textendash}Lawley, Roy's, Pillai{\textendash}Bartlett) apply. Convenient methods give exact power for the uncorrected and Box conservative tests. Simulations demonstrate that new power approximations for all four UNIREP tests eliminate most inaccuracy in existing methods. In turn, free software implements the approximations to give a better choice of sample size. Two repeated measures power analyses illustrate the methods. The examples highlight the advantages of examining the entire response surface of power as a function of sample size, mean differences, and variability.

Bioinformatics software tools capable of performing this task are available, either for general analysis of HTS data or targeted to a specific sequencing technology. However, most of the existing QC instruments only allow processing of one sample at a time.             Results: Qualimap 2 represents a next step in the QC analysis of HTS data. Along with comprehensive single-sample analysis of alignment data, it includes new modes that allow simultaneous processing and comparison of multiple samples. As with the first version, the new features are available via both graphical and command line interface. Additionally, it includes a large number of improvements proposed by the user community.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cough is a key symptom in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). OBJECTIVE: The study objectives were to test whether cough is related to parameters reflecting their disease severity and whether CF and PCD differ in cough frequency. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we used a microphone-based monitoring system (LEOSound{\textregistered} Monitor) to count the coughs in healthy subjects (HS) and in stable patients with CF and PCD (25 subjects per group) on 2 consecutive nights. RESULTS: The median number of coughs/h in the HS, CF, and PCD groups was 0.0, 1.3, and 0.5 on the first night and 0.0, 2.3, and 0.2 on the second night, respectively. Patients with CF and PCD coughed more than HS (p {$<$} 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively) and CF patients coughed more than PCD patients (p = 0.023). A multivariable mixed model analysis revealed forced expiratory volume in 1 s as an independent risk factor for increased cough frequency in patients. The reliability for repeated measurements was higher for cough epochs/h than for coughs/h (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.75 and 0.49, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CF cough more than patients with PCD. The cough frequency in CF and PCD is associated with parameters reflecting disease severity. Cough frequency is a possible endpoint in clinical trials and cough epochs/h may be more useful than coughs/h.},

We determined {$\beta$}-cell secretory capacity and insulin secretory rates from glucose-potentiated arginine and mixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTTs), respectively, in pancreatic-sufficient cystic fibrosis (PS-CF), PI-CF, and normal control subjects, all with normal glucose tolerance, in order to identify early pathophysiologic defects. Acute islet cell secretory responses were determined under fasting, 230 mg/dL, and 340 mg/dL hyperglycemia clamp conditions. PI-CF subjects had lower acute insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon responses compared with PS-CF and normal control subjects, indicating reduced {$\beta$}-cell secretory capacity and {$\alpha$}-cell function. Fasting proinsulin-to-C-peptide and proinsulin secretory ratios during glucose potentiation were higher in PI-CF, suggesting impaired proinsulin processing. In the first 30 min of the MMTT, insulin secretion was lower in PI-CF compared with PS-CF and normal control subjects, and glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were lower compared with PS-CF, and after 180 min, glucose was higher in PI-CF compared with normal control subjects. These findings indicate that despite "normal" glucose tolerance, adolescents and adults with PI-CF have impairments in functional islet mass and associated early-phase insulin secretion, which with decreased incretin responses likely leads to the early development of postprandial hyperglycemia in CF.},

Better understanding of the biological mechanisms relevant to each trait promotes understanding of the etiology of the disease and the potential for targeted and effective treatment plans. There have been many efforts towards omics data integration and network reconstruction, but limited work has examined the incorporation of relevant (quantitative) phenotypic traits.                                         Results               We propose a novel technique, sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet), for integrating multiple omics data types along with a quantitative phenotype of interest, and for constructing multi-omics networks that are specific to the phenotype. As a case study, we focus on miRNA{\textendash}mRNA networks. Through simulations, we demonstrate that SmCCNet has better overall prediction performance compared to popular gene expression network construction and integration approaches under realistic settings. Applying SmCCNet to studies on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and breast cancer, we found enrichment of known relevant pathways (e.g. the Cadherin pathway for COPD and the interferon-gamma signaling pathway for breast cancer) as well as less known omics features that may be important to the diseases. Although those applications focus on miRNA{\textendash}mRNA co-expression networks, SmCCNet is applicable to a variety of omics and other data types. It can also be easily generalized to incorporate multiple quantitative phenotype simultaneously. The versatility of SmCCNet suggests great potential of the approach in many areas.                                         Availability and implementation               The SmCCNet algorithm is written in R, and is freely available on the web at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SmCCNet/index.html.

The focus of our study was to examine the infection characteristics of PEx in children with CF before the availability of ETI (2018) and following ETI approval and during emergence from COVID-19 (2022).                                         Methods               We conducted a multicenter (5 sites) retrospective review collecting data on children with CF over 12-month periods in 2018 and in 2022 who were hospitalized for PEx and treated with IV antibiotics. We analyzed the number of PEx, bacterial and fungal organisms identified by CF respiratory cultures and IV antibiotics used empirically at hospital admission.                                         Results               The number of hospitalizations for PEx decreased from 414 in 2018 to 163 in 2022. The most common organisms identified in all centers were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) and Candida species, with no apparent overall difference in the relative percentages of pathogens isolated between 2018 and 2022 (figure 1), although fewer children were infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in 2022 (2.7\%) than in 2018 (10\%) (p=0.014). There was variability in the type of antipseudomonal agents and antistaphylococcal agents used empirically both within and between the different centers (figure 2).                                         Conclusion               Pathogens isolated from respiratory culture associated with PEx demonstrated similar rates of isolation of pathogens in the 2 time periods, consistent with historical CF pathogen isolation. The decreased number of PEx in 2022 compared to 2018 is consistent with the widespread use of ETI. The variability of usage antipseudomonal agents between centers and between years of data collection requires further investigation.

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

Abnormalities are observed early during development. Sun               et al.               reasoned that early intervention using the approved drug VX-770 (ivacaftor), a CFTR modulator, could prevent the development of such abnormalities. The authors tested the effect of in utero and early postnatal VX-770 administration in a ferret model of CF. Lung, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and male reproductive pathologies were partially prevented in ferrets treated prior to and following birth. The results suggest that CFTR plays a critical role in early organ development and that prenatal and postnatal treatment might prevent developmental pathologies and onset of disease.                        ,                             Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (               CFTR               ). In patients with CF, abnormalities initiate in several organs before birth. However, the long-term impact of these in utero pathologies on disease pathophysiology is unclear. To address this issue, we generated ferrets harboring a VX-770 (ivacaftor){\textendash}responsive               CFTR               G551D               mutation. In utero VX-770 administration provided partial protection from developmental pathologies in the pancreas, intestine, and male reproductive tract. Homozygous               CFTR               G551D/G551D               animals showed the greatest VX-770{\textendash}mediated protection from these pathologies. Sustained postnatal VX-770 administration led to improved pancreatic exocrine function, glucose tolerance, growth and survival, and to reduced mucus accumulation and bacterial infections in the lung. VX-770 withdrawal at any age reestablished disease, with the most rapid onset of morbidity occurring when withdrawal was initiated during the first 2 weeks after birth. The results suggest that CFTR is important for establishing organ function early in life. Moreover, this ferret model provides proof of concept for in utero pharmacologic correction of genetic disease and offers opportunities for understanding CF pathogenesis and improving treatment.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Biological networks can provide a system-level understanding of underlying processes. In many contexts, networks have a high degree of modularity, i.e. they consist of subsets of nodes, often known as subnetworks or modules, which are highly interconnected and may perform separate functions. In order to perform subsequent analyses to investigate the association between the identified module and a variable of interest, a module summarization, that best explains the module's information and reduces dimensionality is often needed. Conventional approaches for obtaining network representation typically rely only on the profiles of the nodes within the network while disregarding the inherent network topological information.                                         Results               In this article, we propose NetSHy, a hybrid approach which is capable of reducing the dimension of a network while incorporating topological properties to aid the interpretation of the downstream analyses. In particular, NetSHy applies principal component analysis (PCA) on a combination of the node profiles and the well-known Laplacian matrix derived directly from the network similarity matrix to extract a summarization at a subject level. Simulation scenarios based on random and empirical networks at varying network sizes and sparsity levels show that NetSHy outperforms the conventional PCA approach applied directly on node profiles, in terms of recovering the true correlation with a phenotype of interest and maintaining a higher amount of explained variation in the data when networks are relatively sparse. The robustness of NetSHy is also demonstrated by a more consistent correlation with the observed phenotype as the sample size decreases. Lastly, a genome-wide association study is performed as an application of a downstream analysis, where NetSHy summarization scores on the biological networks identify more significant single nucleotide polymorphisms than the conventional network representation.                                         Availability and implementation               R code implementation of NetSHy is available at https://github.com/thaovu1/NetSHy                                         Supplementary information               Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In order to correctly decode phenotypic information from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, careful selection of the RNA-seq quantification measure is critical for inter-sample comparisons and for downstream analyses, such as differential gene expression between two or more conditions. Several methods have been proposed and continue to be used. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the best gene expression quantification method for RNA-seq data analysis.                                         Methods               In the present study, we used replicate samples from each of 20 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models spanning 15 tumor types, for a total of 61 human tumor xenograft samples available through the NCI patient-derived model repository (PDMR). We compared the reproducibility across replicate samples based on TPM (transcripts per million), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), and normalized counts using coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis.                                         Results               Our results revealed that hierarchical clustering on normalized count data tended to group replicate samples from the same PDX model together more accurately than TPM and FPKM data. Furthermore, normalized count data were observed to have the lowest median coefficient of variation (CV), and highest intraclass correlation (ICC) values across all replicate samples from the same model and for the same gene across all PDX models compared to TPM and FPKM data.                                         Conclusion               We provided compelling evidence for a preferred quantification measure to conduct downstream analyses of PDX RNA-seq data. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of RNA-seq data quantification measures conducted on PDX models, which are known to be inherently more variable than cell line models. Our findings are consistent with what others have shown for human tumors and cell lines and add further support to the thesis that normalized counts are the best choice for the analysis of RNA-seq data across samples.},
