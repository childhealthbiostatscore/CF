  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Diabetes is common in cystic fibrosis and increases the risk of death, yet the role of hyperglycemia remains unproven. An association between glycemia and mortality would provide compelling evidence to support glucose lowering in cystic fibrosis--related diabetes (CFRD).                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               Using the U.K. Cystic Fibrosis Registry, we analyzed longitudinal data from 2006 to 2009 in 520 individuals with diabetes. We tested the association between HbA1c and mortality.                                         RESULTS               During a median follow-up of 2 years, 36 patients died. The median value of HbA1c was higher in those who died (7.3\%) than in those who did not (6.7\%). An HbA1c value of {$\geq$}6.5\% was associated with a threefold increased risk of death (hazard ratio 3.2 [95\% CI 1.4--7.3]; P = 0.005) independent of potential confounders.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Hyperglycemia trebles the risk of death in patients with CFRD. These findings provide epidemiologic support for continued efforts to improve glycemic control.},

  abstract = {Background Ivacaftor is the first cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator demonstrating clinical benefit in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). As ivacaftor is intended for chronic, lifelong use, understanding long-term effects is important for patients and healthcare providers.Objective This ongoing, observational, postapproval safety study evaluates clinical outcomes and disease progression in ivacaftor-treated patients using data from the US and the UK CF registries following commercial availability.Methods Annual analyses compare ivacaftor-treated and untreated matched comparator patients for: risks of death, transplantation, hospitalisation, pulmonary exacerbation; prevalence of CF-related complications and microorganisms and lung function changes in a subset of patients who initiated ivacaftor in the first year of commercial availability. Results from the 2014 analyses (2 and 3 years following commercial availability in the UK and USA, respectively) are presented here.Results Analyses included 1256 ivacaftor-treated and 6200 comparator patients from the USA and 411 ivacaftor-treated and 2069 comparator patients from the UK. No new safety concerns were identified based on the evaluation of clinical outcomes included in the analyses. As part of safety evaluations, ivacaftor-treated US patients were observed to have significantly lower risks of death (0.6\% vs 1.6\%, p=0.0110), transplantation (0.2\% vs 1.1\%, p=0.0017), hospitalisation (27.5\% vs 43.1\%, p\&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary exacerbation (27.8\% vs 43.3\%, p\&lt;0.0001) relative to comparators; trends were similar in the UK. In both registries, ivacaftor-treated patients had a lower prevalence of CF-related complications and select microorganisms and had better preserved lung function.Conclusions While general limitations of observational research apply, analyses revealed favourable results for clinically important outcomes among ivacaftor-treated patients, adding to the growing body of literature supporting disease modification by CFTR modulation with ivacaftor.EU PAS registration number EUPAS4270},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Diabetes is increasingly common in cystic fibrosis, but little information describing its influence on mortality exists. Using national U.K. data, in this study we document diabetes-specific mortality rates, estimate the impact of diabetes on survival, and estimate population-attributable fractions.                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               This retrospective cohort study identified 8,029 individuals aged 0--65 years from the U.K. Cystic Fibrosis Registry (1996--2005). A total of 5,892 patients were included in analyses of mortality rates, and 4,234 were included in analyses of risk factors. We calculated age-adjusted mortality rates using Poisson regression, standardized mortality ratios using the population of England and Wales, and relative risks using proportional hazards modeling.                                         RESULTS               During 17,672 person-years of follow-up, 393 subjects died. The age-adjusted mortality rate was 1.8 per 100 person-years (95\% CI 1.6--2.0). The age-adjusted mortality rates per 100 person-years were 2.0 (1.8--2.4) in female subjects and 1.6 (1.4--1.9) in male subjects, and 4.2 (3.4--5.1) in individuals with diabetes vs. 1.5 (1.3--1.7) in those without diabetes. Independent risk factors for death included diabetes (hazard ratio 1.31 [95\% CI 1.03--1.67], female sex (1.71 [1.36--2.14]) plus poorer pulmonary function, lower BMI, Burkholderia cepacia infection, absence of Staphylococcus aureus infection, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, liver disease, prior organ transplantation, and corticosteroid use.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Individuals with cystic fibrosis die earlier if they have diabetes, which, if delayed or better treated, might reasonably extend survival; this hypothesis merits testing.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Context               Cystic fibrosis--related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common extrapulmonary complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). Approximately 40\% of people with CF who are older than 20 years have CFRD. Presence of CFRD is associated with poor health outcomes in people with CF.                                         Objective               This review summarizes current knowledge on pathophysiology of CFRD.                                         Methods               A PubMed review of the literature was conducted, with search terms that included CFRD, cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis related diabetes, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Additional sources were identified through manual searches of reference lists.               Pathophysiology of CFRD: The pathophysiology underlying development of glucose tolerance abnormalities in CF is complex and not fully understood. {$\beta$}-cell loss and functional impairment of the remaining {$\beta$}-cell function results in progressive insulin insufficiency. Factors that may contribute to development of CFRD include local islet and systemic inflammation, alterations in the incretion hormone axis, varying degrees of insulin resistance and genetic factors related to type 2 diabetes.                                         Conclusion               The prevalence of CFRD is expected to further increase with improving life expectancy of people with CF. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the development of CFRD and the impact of diabetes on clinical outcomes in CF.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes (CFRD) diagnosis and management have considerably changed since diabetes was first shown to be associated with a poor prognosis in subjects with CF. Current trends in CFRD prevalence, incidence, and mortality were determined from a comprehensive clinical database.                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               Data were reviewed from 872 CF patients followed at the University of Minnesota during three consecutive intervals: 1992--1997, 1998--2002, and 2003--2008.                                         RESULTS               CFRD is currently present in 2\% of children, 19\% of adolescents, and 40--50\% of adults. Incidence and prevalence are higher in female subjects aged 30--39 years; otherwise, there are no sex differences. In younger individuals, CFRD without fasting hyperglycemia predominates, but fasting hyperglycemia prevalence rises with age. CFRD mortality has significantly decreased over time. From 1992--1997 to 2003--2008, mortality rate in female subjects dropped by \&gt;50\% from 6.9 to 3.2 deaths per 100 patient-years and in male subjects from 6.5 to 3.8 deaths per 100 patient-years. There is no longer a sex difference in mortality. Diabetes was previously diagnosed as a perimorbid event in nearly 20\% of patients, but of 61 patients diagnosed with diabetes during 2003--2008, only 2 died. Lung function but not nutritional status is still worse in CF patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. Nutritional status and pulmonary status are similar between patients without fasting hyperglycemia and those with fasting hyperglycemia.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Previously noted sex differences in mortality have disappeared, and the gap in mortality between CF patients with and without diabetes has considerably narrowed. We believe that early diagnosis and aggressive treatment have played a major role in improving survival in these patients.},
