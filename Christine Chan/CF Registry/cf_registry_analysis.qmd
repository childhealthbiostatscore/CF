In @tbl-incidence_cffpr, incidence per year is calculated as the number of new CFRD diagnoses (by registry definition alone) per 1,000 person-years of those at risk, excluding previously identified cases.

In @tbl-prevalence_cffpr, prevalence is calculated as the total number of CFRD cases (by registry definition alone) seen in clinic divided by the total number of people seen in clinic in a given year.

In @tbl-screening, people with CFRD (by either registry definition or OGTT) and those under 10 were excluded. Screening rate is calculated as the number of people with an OGTT divided by the total number of people seen in clinic that year.
