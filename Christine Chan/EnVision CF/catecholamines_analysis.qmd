# Data cleaning

- BMI percentiles were calculated using the `childsds` R package, assuming that male = 1 and female = 2 for the `Sex` variable. Those with age > 20 were considered age = 20 for the purposes of percentile calculations.

- Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and insulin were log transformed for modeling purposes.

### `adren_score`

`adren_score` was modeled using a generalized linear mixed effect model assuming a Poisson distribution for the outcome and a log link function. We also considered a negative binomial model, but the Poisson model was better by AIC. AICs for the Poisson and a zero-inflated Poisson were similar, so the Poisson was chosen for ease of interpretation. The following models were also determined based on AIC.

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Fit
# Poisson model better than NB by AIC and BIC
mod <- glmer(adren_score ~ Timepoint * Hypo70 + (1 | study_id),
  data = lmm_df,
  family = "poisson"
)
mod %>% tbl_regression(intercept = T, exponentiate = T)
means <- data.frame(emmeans(mod, c("Timepoint", "Hypo70"), type = "response"))
colnames(means) <- c(
  "Timepoint", "Hypo70", "Rate", "SE", "df", "CI Lower Limit", "CI Upper Limit"
)
means %>%
  gt(caption = "LS Rates") %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 2)
# Plot
ggplot(means, aes(
  x = as.numeric(as.character(Timepoint)), y = Rate, colour = Hypo70,
  group = Hypo70
)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = `CI Lower Limit`, ymax = `CI Upper Limit`),
    width = 3
  ) +
  geom_line() +

  ylab("LS Rates adren_score") +
  xlab("Timepoint") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

### `neuro_score`

`neuro_score` was modeled using a zero-inflated Poisson model with random intercept for participant and an intercept as the only fixed effect in the zero part of the model.
