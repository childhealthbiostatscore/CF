# Data Cleaning Steps

1. Participants who answered "I don't know" or "no" on the variable `TakingTrikafta` were excluded from these analyses.

```{python}
# | include: false
# | eval: false
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport
# EDA
profile = ProfileReport(df, explorative=True)
# Saving results to a HTML file
profile.to_file(
    "/Volumes/PEDS/RI Biostatistics Core/Shared/Shared Projects/Vigers/CF/Emily Muther/Body Image and Trikafta/Reports/eda.html")
```

```{python}
# Filter
df = df[df["TakingTrikafta"] == "yes"]
```

```{python}
# | label: tbl-planets
# | tbl-cap: Planets

```

# Figure

```{python}
# | label: fig-planets
# | fig-cap: Planets
